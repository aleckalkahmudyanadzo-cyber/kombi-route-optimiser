# 🚐 Kombi Route Optimizer

A shortest path finder for Gweru's kombi (minibus taxi) network, built to explore
and compare **Dijkstra's algorithm** and **A\* search** on a real-world-inspired
transport graph. Given two stops, it finds the cheapest, fastest, or shortest
route and visualizes it on an interactive graph.

Built as part of my Design & Analysis of Algorithms coursework at Midlands
State University, Computer Science.

## Why this project

Kombis are the backbone of urban transport in Zimbabwe, but there's no tool
for comparing routes by cost, time, or distance the way ride-hailing apps do
elsewhere. This project models that problem as a weighted graph and applies
classic pathfinding algorithms to solve it  a small but complete example of
taking algorithms from the classroom into a locally relevant application.

## Features

- **Three optimization modes**: cheapest fare, fastest time, shortest distance
- **Two algorithms**: Dijkstra (guaranteed optimal on any weight) and A*
  (heuristic-guided search using real coordinates, faster in practice)
- **Interactive graph visualization** of all stops and the highlighted route
- **REST API** so the routing logic is decoupled from the frontend
- **Unit tested** core algorithms

## Tech stack

- Python 3 (OOP graph model, `graph.py`)
- Flask (REST API, `app.py`)
- Vanilla JS + [vis-network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/) (frontend)
- pytest (tests)

## Running it locally

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Algorithm design & complexity analysis

Each stop is a `Node`; each kombi route is a bidirectional `Edge` carrying
**three independent weights**  distance (km), fare (USD), and time (min) 
so the same graph answers "cheapest", "fastest", and "shortest" queries just
by switching which weight the search uses.

**Dijkstra's algorithm** (binary heap implementation):
- Time complexity: `O((V + E) log V)`
- Guaranteed to find the optimal path for any of the three weight types
- Used as the baseline / correctness reference

**A\* search**:
- Time complexity: same worst case as Dijkstra, `O((V + E) log V)`, but
  explores far fewer nodes in practice
- Uses **haversine (straight-line) distance** between real stop coordinates
  as the heuristic
- This heuristic is only *admissible* (guarantees optimality) when optimizing
  for `distance_km`, since it's derived from actual geography this is
  called out explicitly in `graph.py` rather than glossed over, since using
  a distance based heuristic to optimize for fare or time isn't theoretically
  guaranteed to be optimal, even though it still returns a good result in
  this dataset

This distinction  where a heuristic works and where it stops being
admissible  was the most interesting part of building this, and it's the
kind of nuance that's easy to miss if you just copy a textbook A*
implementation without thinking about what the heuristic actually represents.

## Data note

Stop names and connectivity reflect real Gweru suburbs and kombi ranks.
Exact distances, fares, and travel times are **estimates** for demonstration
 before treating this as production-accurate, replace `data/gweru_routes.json`
with surveyed figures.

## Possible extensions

- Time-of-day traffic weighting
- Multi-hop fare aggregation matching real kombi fare-per-leg pricing
- GPS-based real-time stop suggestions
- Expand to Harare/Bulawayo route networks
